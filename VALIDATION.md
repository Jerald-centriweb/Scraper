# Estate Scraper - Production Setup Validation

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria Verification

### 1. Docker Compose Setup
- ✅ `docker-compose up` builds and runs API, Worker, and Redis
- ✅ All services properly configured with dependencies and health checks
- ✅ Non-root containers with restart policies

### 2. API Endpoints
- ✅ `/health` returns success with Redis and queue counts
- ✅ `/jobs` accepts valid payloads and returns jobId
- ✅ Validation errors return 400 with Zod safeParse
- ✅ `/queue/status` requires x-admin-token if API_ADMIN_TOKEN is set
- ✅ Remains open if API_ADMIN_TOKEN is unset (backward-compatible)

### 3. Security & Performance
- ✅ Express trust proxy controlled via TRUST_PROXY env
- ✅ Rate limiting for accurate handling behind reverse proxies
- ✅ CORS protection with configurable origins
- ✅ Token-based authentication for job submission

### 4. Worker Configuration
- ✅ Worker image skips Chromium re-download (PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=true)
- ✅ Proper memory allocation and shared memory settings
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling

### 5. Documentation
- ✅ README provides complete A→Z guide for junior developers
- ✅ Step-by-step setup instructions
- ✅ Troubleshooting section
- ✅ Hand-off checklist
